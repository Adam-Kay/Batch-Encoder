# Batch-Encoder
A small personal project. A .bat file which uses FFMPEG to encode a folder full of video files.

## Dependencies:
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
  - This will at some point be acquired for you, but currently must be downloaded manually first

## Instructions for use ((WIP)):
1) Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/Adam-Kay/Batch-Encoder/releases/latest) of `batch.encoder.v[*].bat`.
2) Place into a folder with video files.
3) Run `batch.encoder.v[*].bat`.
